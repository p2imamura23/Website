<p>Derek Jeter is known by many to be one of the best shortstops in Major League Baseball History. 
Not only did he have an amazing combination of athletic ability along with a high baseball IQ, 
but he also is one of the best people in the game. His consistent work in the community as well as his
legendary work ethic are some of the reasons why I look up to him.

<p>Another reason why Derek Jeter is one of my favorite players ever is his loyalty to New York. Lots of players nowadays
